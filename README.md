# **CloudReduce-for-Azure**

CloudReduce is a repository focused on cost optimization by identifying and minimizing expenses associated with unused resources created by developers in Azure environments.

---

## **Reducing Cloud Costs by Cleaning Up Unused Snapshots and Disks in Azure**

### **Overview**

Efficient management of cloud resources is crucial to optimizing costs and enhancing operational efficiency. This project provides a Python-based solution for automating the cleanup of unused Azure snapshots and Managed Disks, thereby reducing storage expenses and streamlining resource management.

---

## **Use Case**

### **Scenario**

A tech company extensively utilizes Azure cloud infrastructure, granting developers the freedom to create virtual machines and Managed Disks for various projects. Over time, snapshots created for backups or testing are often forgotten, leading to the accumulation of unattached snapshots and unused Managed Disks.

### **Problem**

Unattended snapshots and disks result in significant Azure storage costs, draining resources without contributing to operational value. Without systematic tracking, these idle resources can quickly spiral out of control, increasing unnecessary expenses.

### **Solution**

This automated Python script leverages Azure SDKs to:

1. Identify all snapshots across the subscription.
2. Check whether snapshots are linked to active Managed Disks or virtual machines.
3. Delete snapshots and disks that are unattached or unused.

### **Outcome**

- **Cost Savings:** Reduces Azure storage costs, saving potentially thousands annually.
- **Improved Management:** Enhances visibility and control over cloud resources.
- **Policy Encouragement:** Promotes tagging and cleanup practices to prevent future inefficiencies.

---

## **Key Features**

- Automates the cleanup of Azure snapshots and disks to reduce costs.
- Uses environment variables from a `.env` file for secure Azure credentials.
- Dockerized for seamless deployment and ease of use.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you meet the following requirements:

1. **Azure Subscription:** A valid subscription ID.
2. **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Authentication:** The script uses Azure identity credentials. Set up authentication as explained [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python).
3. **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions (e.g., Contributor role) to manage snapshots and disks within your Azure subscription.
4. **Docker Installed:** Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. For installation guides, visit [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

---

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nusaifkhan/CloudReduce-for-Azure.git
cd CloudReduce-for-Azure
```

### **2. Create a Logs Directory**

Ensure logs are persisted by creating a directory for them:

```bash
mkdir logs
```

### **3. Create a `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to securely store Azure credentials:

```plaintext
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your_subscription_id
```

Replace `your_client_id`, `your_tenant_id`, `your_client_secret`, and `your_subscription_id` with your Azure details.

---

## **Dockerizing the Application**

### **Step 1: Check the Docker Configuration**

The repository includes:

- A `Dockerfile` to build the container image.
- A `docker-compose.yml` file to configure and run the container.

### **Step 2: Load `.env` in Docker Compose**

The `docker-compose.yml` is configured to automatically load the `.env` file for credentials.

---

## **How to Build and Run**

### **1. Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### **2. Run the Docker Container**

Start the containerized application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The script will execute inside the container and log its activity to `logs/cleanup_log.txt` on your host machine.

---

## **How It Works**

- **Dockerfile**: Builds a Python environment with all dependencies and includes the `.env` file for credentials.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the container runtime configuration, including loading the `.env` file and mounting the `logs/` directory.
- **Logs**: The `logs/` directory stores logs generated by the script.

---

## **Logs and Debugging**

The application logs all its activities to a file in the `logs/` directory:

**Path**: `logs/cleanup_log.txt`

**Content**: Details of deleted snapshots, errors, and other actions.

### **Viewing Logs**

To view the log file, run:

```bash
cat logs/cleanup_log.txt
```

If there are any issues, the log file will provide useful insights for debugging.

---

## **Configuration for Beginners**

Hereâ€™s a simple step-by-step guide to get started:

1. Install Docker following [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Clone the repository and create the `logs/` directory.
3. Create the `.env` file with your Azure credentials.
4. Build and run the application using Docker Compose commands.
5. Check the logs to confirm everything is running smoothly.
